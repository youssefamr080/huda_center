## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our project very seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, we appreciate you reporting it to us responsibly. Please refrain from disclosing the vulnerability publicly until we have had an opportunity to investigate and address it.

**How to Report:**

1.  **Email Us:** Send a detailed report of the vulnerability to [security@yourproject.com](mailto:security@yourproject.com). Please use a descriptive subject line, such as "Security Vulnerability Report - [Component/Module Name]".

2.  **Include Detail:** Your report should include as much detail as possible, including:
    *   A clear description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   The affected version(s) of the project.
    *   Any potential impact of the vulnerability.
    *   Any supporting materials, such as screenshots or code samples, if available.

3.  **Confidentiality:** Please do not include any sensitive personal information in your report.

**Our Process:**

1.  **Acknowledgement:**  We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.

2.  **Investigation:** Our security team will investigate the vulnerability and verify its existence.

3.  **Response:** We will provide you with an update on the investigation and a plan of action within 7 days of acknowledging the report. The timeframe for resolution will depend on the complexity of the vulnerability and its impact.

4.  **Disclosure:** Once the vulnerability is resolved and a fix is released, we will coordinate with you about public disclosure.  We will typically credit you for the discovery (if you choose to be credited).

**What to Expect:**

*   **Accepted Vulnerabilities:**  If a reported vulnerability is deemed valid, we will work to fix it promptly and provide a security patch or update.
*   **Declined Vulnerabilities:** If a reported issue is determined not to be a security vulnerability, we will communicate this to you with the reasoning. This could be due to the issue being a misunderstanding, a known limitation, or not posing a security risk.

**Scope:**

This policy covers vulnerabilities discovered within our project's codebase, including:

*   Software flaws and defects that can lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or service disruptions.
*   Configuration issues that can weaken security.
*   Any other potential security weaknesses related to our project.

**Important Notes:**
*   We are committed to addressing security issues with the utmost priority.
*   We encourage responsible disclosure and will not pursue legal action against those who report vulnerabilities in good faith.

Thank you for helping us keep our project safe and secure!
